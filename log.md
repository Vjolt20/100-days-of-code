### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Free code camp's Front End Development Certification HTML5 and CSS. 37 exercises in! 


**Thoughts:** I feel like I picked up the CSS aspects quite easily. 

**Link to work:** Stopped after completing: "Give a Background Color to a Div Element"
